                        Have you ever fascinated yourself with how a switch works? or the stars twinkle?
                        As life progresses, a majority of us get busy with satisfying our responsibilities and relaxing
                        through the stress of preparing for the next 'need' before it manifests into our lives.
                        And with all this comes the joy of living, some in memories that are stacks of mere moments after
                        a day worth of labour and some in things, materials that perish like we do, and have a meaning,
                        purpose and significance like we do.<br/>
                        Why do we associate stress with our house's finances?
                        or our daily chores? In zen meditation, doing a chore such as making your bed is associated to
                        bliss and in the military it is associated to discipline. Two very contrasting opinions about
                        the same activity.  With ClansClans we aim to provide an ordinary experience in an
                        extraordinary way. It is the same chores, memories, income and expenses but looked at
                        with the glasses of Willy Wonka! <br/>
                        After wondering about how to attempt such a creative task through the Loompa land
                        sucking on a four colored popsicle, we have finally arrived to our path.<br/>
                        The name is simple. ClansClans. We are a social networking site which is meant for
                        close friends and families. None of the Facebook stuff here.<br/>
                        You choose who is a part of your clan. Every clan has memories they wish to share,
                        expenses that they would split and events that they dare not forget. ClansClans takes
                        care of all of this in the simplest ways imaginable.<br/>
                        We are a one-stop shop for your household chores, memories that should be privy to you
                        and provide for better organization.
